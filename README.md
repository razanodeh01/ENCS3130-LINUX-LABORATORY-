# " Automated Linux/Unix Command Manual Generation "
# Description 
<p> This project aims to automate the generation of a comprehensive system manual for Linux/Unix commands using hell scripting, streamlining the documentation process for system administrators. Each command entry in the manual includes a description, version history, example usage, and related commands, adhering to the CISCO template for consistency. Verification involves checking the generated content against existing documentation and running commands for accuracy. Additionally, the project focuses on continuous improvement by incorporating features like a command recommendation system based on user preferences and a search functionality for quick access to specific commands or topics. Verification steps include utilizing commands like 'compgen' to list available commands and extracting command descriptions from man pages.
